# Choose Your App

Build an App similar to our Amazon clone app with whatever you want instead of Amazon. I’ve provided a sample of one that might use animals as what you’re creating but again just decide what fits best with your personal hobbies as doing something you enjoy will help you get through the work.

### Sample **Animal Model**

- species: String
- extinct: Boolean
- location: String
- lifeExpectancy: Number

**THIS IS DUE April 5th**

Minimum requirements:

- Connect to MongoDB
- Have READ and CREATE functionality (index, show, new)
- Use EJS to render these pages

**Hungry for More**
- edit route
- delete route
- add session based auth
